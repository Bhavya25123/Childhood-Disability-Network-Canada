## 11. Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue | Suggested Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Form fields stay highlighted in red | Hover over or read the inline error message, update the value, and blur the input to re-run validation. |
| MP search returns no results | Try a larger geographic area or verify that your backend database contains `MPContacts` and `MPEmail` records. |
| Toasts report “Enrollment service unreachable” | Confirm the backend server is online and your internet connection is stable.【F:CDNC-frontend/src/pages/JoinCommunity.tsx†L83-L117】 |
| “Copy draft” fails in some browsers | Manually select the letter text and copy it using `Ctrl+C`/`Cmd+C`. Clipboard access can be blocked by browser privacy settings.【F:CDNC-frontend/src/pages/SendLetter.tsx†L238-L273】 |
